## Future Work:
- Various new skins feature for sonic - select before starting the game in main menu scene & some skins can be unlocked when you beat certain score.
- Add power ups like Mario's.
- More feature such as, Movements controls (WASD) + Dash + Shoot.
- Add rings distant above platforms - jump to get them.
- Add Castle Vania villains:
day - slow run
    if day for 1000ms { transition day to night }
night - vampire run
    if night for 5000ms { transition to day }
every time day comes it slows down, and picks pace when night falls
